Ah! You want a single-file README for your GitHub repository. Here’s a clean, professional README.md you can directly use:

# Sudoku Game in Java (JavaFX)

A fully-functional Sudoku game built using **Java** and **JavaFX**, featuring a graphical user interface, Sudoku game logic, and real-time user input validation. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, event handling, and 2D array manipulation in Java.

---

## Features

- Generates a new Sudoku puzzle every time the game starts.  
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using **JavaFX**.  
- Highlights invalid inputs and prevents rule-breaking moves.  
- Tracks game state: New, Active, Complete.  
- Supports checking rows, columns, and 3x3 squares for validity.  
- Easy-to-read design with 9x9 Sudoku grid.  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**  
- **JavaFX** for GUI components  
- Object-Oriented Programming principles  
- Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`) for logic handling

   git clone <repository-url>


3. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions).

4. Add JavaFX libraries to your module path.

5. Run SudokuApp.java to start the game.

Usage

- Click on any empty tile and enter numbers 1-9.

- The game will automatically prevent invalid moves.

- Complete the Sudoku puzzle to win the game.

- Pre-filled tiles cannot be changed.

Future Improvements

- Add a timer and score tracking.

- Implement difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

- Include hints for players.

- Allow saving and loading game states.

- Add highlighting for selected rows, columns, and squares.
