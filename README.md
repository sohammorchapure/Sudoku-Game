# Sudoku Game in Java (JavaFX)

A fully-functional Sudoku game built using **Java** and **JavaFX**, featuring a graphical user interface, Sudoku game logic, and real-time user input validation. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, event handling, and 2D array manipulation in Java.

## Features

- Generates a new Sudoku puzzle every time the game starts.  
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using **JavaFX**.  
- Highlights invalid inputs and prevents rule-breaking moves.  
- Tracks game state: New, Active, Complete.  
- Supports checking rows, columns, and 3x3 squares for validity.  
- Easy-to-read design with 9x9 Sudoku grid.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**  
- **JavaFX** for GUI components  
- Object-Oriented Programming principles  
- Collections (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`) for logic handling

This is ready to **copy as `README.md`** into your GitHub repo.  

If you want, I can also make an **ultra-short, recruiter-friendly version** that highlights your Java,
